        <h1>How Should We</h1>
        <h2>Face Depression</h2>
        
        <p id="info1">The attitude we should take towards depression, just that simple.</p>
        <p id="info2">We should not exaggerate the harm of depression. It will only add more burden to patients with depression.  All we have to do is treat it like a normal disease. </p>
        <p id="info2">See a doctor, follow the doctor's instructions, and keep in touch with others. You can share your feelings with family or friends, and SYM (link to sharing content page) is a good choice as well.</p>
